# Armour
Armour is an interactive fiction adventure game re-imagined.

Status: Far from done.

Personal project trying to re-imagine the old Interactive Fiction inspired by games such as Zork, and
Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, however, with an online aspect, with a back-end server for clients to
communicate with and the client being ran on a web browser instead of a local program.
